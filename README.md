# ConnectingDots
This is the code used to create a shiny dashboard with the connections between Goals, Targets and Indicators of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and its relationship to Responses-Presions-State-Benefits framework.

This code uses the googlesheets4 package to connect to an online table. For this it uses a .secrets folder that contains the credentials to access files in a google account. This folder is not added in the repository.
